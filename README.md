### Hi there 👋

Hi, I'm Łukasz, web developer. 

With over a decade of professional experience, 
I’ve helped rethink, prototype & develop products
for the smallest of small startups, to some of the most innovative 
software as a service solutions.

I'm enthusiastic about continuous integration & delivery, devops,
test & behaviour driven development in agile environments, 
highly available distributed solutions,
adopting microservices and dynamic cloud based infrastructure.
